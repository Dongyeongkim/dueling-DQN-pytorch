# dueling-DQN-pytorch
very easy implementation of dueling DQN in pytorch with gym.CartPole-v0

all things are in one file, easily to follow~~

## requirement 

- tensorflow (for tensorboard logging)
- pytorch (>=1.0, 1.0.1 used in my experiment)
- gym

in CartPole-v0 the network will convergence to 200 episode reward very quickly~~

## other environment

the implementation could be easily expanded to other environment, I will upload an implementation in Visual Doom game soon~
